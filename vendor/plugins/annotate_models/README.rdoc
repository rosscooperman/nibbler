== AnnotateModels

Add a comment summarizing the current schema to the bottom of each 
ActiveRecord model, fixture file.

If you are using Object Daddy, it`ll annotate your example files too.

 # == Schema Info
 #
 # Table name: line_items
 #
 #  id                  :integer(11)    not null, primary key
 #  quantity            :integer(11)    not null
 #  product_id          :integer(11)    not null
 #  unit_price          :float
 #  order_id            :integer(11)
 #

  class LineItem < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :product
   . . .
   
Annotates geometrical columns, geom type and srid, when using SpatialAdapter or PostgisAdapter:

 # == Schema Info
 #
 # Table name: trips
 #
 #  local           :geometry        point, 4326
 #  path            :geometry        line_string, 4326
          
== Warning

Note that this code will blow away the initial/final comment
block in your models if it looks like it was previously added
by annotate models, so you don't want to add additional text
to an automatically created comment block.

       * * Back up your model files before using... * *
